Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Japan was missing in a few simulations but the other results seem reasonable

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100 simulations seem good enough given the number of teams involved and the outcome of all of the simulations
