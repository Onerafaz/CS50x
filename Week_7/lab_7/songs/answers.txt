For the given data with an average danceability of 0.71646, an average energy of 0.65906, and an average valence of 0.484443, we can make some tentative observations:

Danceability: The average danceability of approximately 0.72 suggests that the listener's top 100 songs from 2018 tended to be relatively danceable or had rhythms suitable for dancing. This indicates that they might have preferred more energetic and lively songs.
Energy: With an average energy of 0.66, the music selection was moderately energetic. Songs with higher energy tend to be more intense and fast-paced, which could indicate that the listener enjoyed music that was quite dynamic.
Valence: The average valence of around 0.48 implies that the music tended to have a mix of positive and negative emotional characteristics. Valence represents the musical positiveness conveyed by a track, so a value closer to 1 would indicate more positive or happy-sounding songs.
